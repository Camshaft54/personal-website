# Personal Website

This is the source for my personal website where I display information about myself and projects I've worked on!

## Installation

*Mostly for myself so I don't forget :)*

1. Install WebStorm
2. Install Node.js (currently using v24)
3. `yarn install` (`npm install --global yarn` first if not installed)
4. `yarn dev` to start the app on localhost
5. `yarn build` to build
